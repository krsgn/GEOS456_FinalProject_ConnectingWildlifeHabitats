# GEOS456

This project used Python and ArcPy to model and connect fragmented grizzly and black bear habitats across Kananaskis Country. The goal was to identify optimal wildlife corridors based on terrain, land cover, and proximity to infrastructure and hydrology, supporting wildlife movement and biodiversity conservation.

Using ArcPy, I automated geoprocessing workflows for raster analysis, reclassification, and cost surface generation. I combined multiple cost factors, including terrain ruggedness, land cover, and distance to roads, trails, and water, into a weighted cost surface to determine least-cost paths between habitat patches. The final outputs included a network of optimal wildlife corridors, grid statistics, and an automated map export summarizing the results.
